PWA Icons Required

For full PWA functionality, you need to add the following icon files to the /public directory:

- icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)
- favicon.ico (standard favicon)

You can generate these icons using tools like:

The icons should represent the FitLog app logo/branding.
